# MRS — 2-minute demo script

Use this for a short pitch or video. Read at a natural pace; **[actions]** are in brackets. Total runtime ~2 minutes.

## Script

**[0:00 – 0:15] Show the app.**

> "This is **MRS: Medical Research Synthesizer** — an AI assistant that answers clinical questions using real medical literature and gives you a cited research brief in one place. You ask in plain language; MRS finds the papers, synthesizes the evidence, and shows you the sources."

**[0:15 – 0:35] Point to "Ask a research question" and the suggested chips.**

> "You can type any question or use **suggested questions** for one-click demos. I'll click **GLP-1 and CV risk**."

**[Click the "GLP-1 and CV risk" chip. Wait for the brief to load.]**

> "In a few seconds we get an **AI-generated research brief**: a short synthesis with key findings, confidence, and timing. You can **click underlined text** to see which citation supports it — everything is traceable."

**[0:35 – 0:55] Point to confidence, evidence, and Pin.**

> "We show **supporting evidence**, **conflicting signals**, and **limitations** so you see the full picture. **Pin** saves this to the sidebar for later. **Copy** lets you export the answer or references as Markdown."

**[0:55 – 1:15] Run a second query.**

> "For a different angle I'll use **Templates** — for example **Compare treatments**."

**[Open Templates, click "Compare treatments" (or click "SGLT2 in CKD" or "Heart failure 2024" for variety).]**

> "Same flow: question in, brief out, with citations. In the sidebar, **Sessions** groups your queries by topic so you can re-run or track a research thread."

**[1:15 – 1:35] Briefly point to sidebar.**

> "You can **upload your own PDFs** so MRS searches your corpus. **System status** shows that Bedrock, the vector store, and S3 are healthy. The goal is **evidence at everyone's fingertips** — for clinicians, researchers, and patients — with clear provenance and no black box."

**[1:35 – 2:00] Closing.**

> "So: ask a question, get a cited brief, pin and export what matters. That's MRS — putting evidence at everyone's fingertips. Thanks."

## Sample queries to run

Use these during the demo. **Suggested questions** (one click) or **Templates** (open dropdown, then click) work best for speed.

### One-click (Suggested questions — "Try:" row)

| Click this chip        | What it runs |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **GLP-1 and CV risk**  | How GLP-1 agonists affect cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes. |
| **SGLT2 in CKD**       | SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease (guidance, monitoring). |
| **Heart failure 2024** | Practice-changing heart failure trials in 2024. |
| **Compare GLP-1 vs SGLT2** | Head-to-head comparison for type 2 diabetes. |

### From Templates (Templates → pick one)

| Template              | Example question |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Evidence summary** | Summarise the key evidence in bullets. |
| **Compare treatments** | Compare GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes. |
| **Patient-friendly** | Explain the main benefits and side effects in simple terms for patients. |
| **Limitations only** | What are the main limitations of the evidence? |

### Type your own (if you have a few extra seconds)

- *How effective are GLP‑1 agonists for cardiometabolic risk reduction?*
- *What are key limitations of GLP-1 trials?*
- *3 practice-changing trials in heart failure in 2024?*

## Suggested 2-minute flow

1. **Query 1:** Click **"GLP-1 and CV risk"** → show brief, confidence, inline citations, Pin/Copy.
2. **Query 2:** Open **Templates** → click **"Compare treatments"** (or **"SGLT2 in CKD"**) → show sidebar Sessions.
3. **Closing:** One line on upload + system status + impact.

This keeps the demo tight and shows the full loop twice in under 2 minutes.
