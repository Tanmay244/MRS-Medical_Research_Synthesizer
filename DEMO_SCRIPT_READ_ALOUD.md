# MRS — End-to-end read-aloud demo script

Read this from top to bottom while you show the app. Lines in *italics* are quick stage directions — glance at them, then say the line that follows.

*[Show the full app.]*

This is MRS: Medical Research Synthesizer. It’s an AI assistant that answers clinical questions using real medical literature and gives you a cited research brief in one place. You ask in plain language; MRS finds the papers, synthesizes the evidence, and shows you the sources so you can verify and dig deeper.

*[Point to the header.]*

Up top we have the app name and tagline, and on the right a theme toggle for light and dark mode, Guided prompts, and Settings.

*[Point to the main card: Ask a research question.]*

The heart of the app is this card: Ask a research question. You can type any clinical question here, or use the suggested questions for a one-click demo.

*[Click the chip “GLP-1 and CV risk.”]*

I’ll click “GLP-1 and CV risk.”

*[Wait for the brief to load.]*

In a few seconds we get an AI-generated research brief: a short synthesis with key findings, confidence, and how long the query took. You can click any underlined text in the answer to see which citation supports it — everything is traceable back to the papers.

*[Scroll a little in the brief; point to the sections.]*

We show supporting evidence, and we have expandable sections for conflicting signals and limitations, so you see where the evidence disagrees or is weak. At the bottom, Key citations lists the actual papers with title, authors, and links.

*[Point to the Pin and Copy buttons.]*

Pin saves this question and answer to the sidebar so you can come back to it. Copy lets you export the answer as plain text, as Markdown, or just the references — useful for notes or reports.

*[Open the Templates dropdown and click “Compare treatments.”]*

For a second example I’ll use Templates. I’ll pick “Compare treatments” — that runs a head-to-head comparison of GLP-1 and SGLT2 inhibitors.

*[When the new brief appears.]*

Same flow: question in, brief out, with citations and confidence. So whether you use a suggested question, a template, or type your own, you get a cited synthesis in one place.

*[Point to the sidebar.]*

In the sidebar, Today’s research snapshot shows your activity — queries, sessions, papers cited. Pinned highlights holds everything you’ve pinned. Sessions groups your queries by topic — you can expand a session and click any question to run it again. Upload Research Document lets you add your own PDFs or documents so MRS can search your corpus. Indexed Documents lists what’s in the system. And System Status shows that Bedrock, the vector store, and S3 are healthy.

*[Back to the main area or a brief.]*

The goal of MRS is to put evidence at everyone’s fingertips — for clinicians who need quick, cited answers during practice, for researchers doing literature review, and for patients and advocates who want understandable, sourced summaries. It doesn’t replace judgment; it supports it with transparent, traceable evidence.

So: ask a question, get a cited brief, pin and export what matters. That’s MRS. Thanks for watching.
